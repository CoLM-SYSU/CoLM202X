! !DESCRIPTION:
!
!  The process of long-wave radiation transmission in the absence of
!  vegetation is similar to the incident diffuse case of short-wave
!  radiation transmission in the absence of vegetation (where long-wave
!  radiation is approximated as a diffuse source). The long-wave
!  radiation flux reaching each component surface is calculated, as well
!  as the long-wave radiation emitted outward from each component
!  surface. Multiple scattering and absorption between components are
!  considered, and a long-wave radiation transmission equilibrium
!  equation is established for solving.
